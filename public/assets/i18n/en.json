    "ABOUT_TITLE": "About",
    "ABOUT_CONTENT": "<p>What began as a simple experiment in high school has become my vocation. Today, my focus is on creating clean, scalable interfaces, combining thoughtful design with best practices. I’m Full Stack, but I have a soft spot for the frontend, and I enjoy building applications that address real needs while being both attractive and fluid.</p><p>Currently, I’m ready to embark on a new project where I can apply my skills and continue learning as I develop.<br>My last role was as a Full Stack Developer on a full-time internship contract at <a href=\"https://es.nttdata.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"dark:font-medium light:font-bold dark:text-d-text-heading light:text-l-text-heading dark:hover:text-d-text-hover-accent light:hover:text-l-text-hover-accent dark:focus-visible:text-d-text-hover-accent light:focus-visible:text-l-text-hover-accent\">NTTData</a>, where for five months I worked on designing and implementing an employee management platform using Angular within a Scrum team. There, I developed both themable interfaces with Bootstrap and external component libraries, as well as custom Angular components tailored to complex business workflows. I also implemented HTTP services for CRUD operations, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and the backend API.</p><p>For my final degree project, I designed and published a library of native Web Components with Stencil called <a href=\"https://github.com/pablodiazjorge/palaze/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"dark:font-medium light:font-bold dark:text-d-text-heading light:text-l-text-heading dark:hover:text-d-text-hover-accent light:hover:text-l-text-hover-accent dark:focus-visible:text-d-text-hover-accent light:focus-visible:text-l-text-hover-accent\">Palaze</a>, accompanied by a live documentation site to facilitate its adoption and integration.</p><p>Each week, I dedicate time to personal projects, either expanding existing applications or coming up with new ones for my portfolio. One of the highlights is an advanced <a href=\"https://github.com/pablodiazjorge/crud-basic-backend/tree/advanced/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"dark:font-medium light:font-bold dark:text-d-text-heading light:text-l-text-heading dark:hover:text-d-text-hover-accent light:hover:text-l-text-hover-accent dark:focus-visible:text-d-text-hover-accent light:focus-visible:text-l-text-hover-accent\">Book Management API</a> (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL) featuring image uploads to Cloudinary, global error handling, configurable logging, pagination, and a comprehensive suite of unit tests. It consists of four projects—two for the backend and two for the frontend—one simple implementation and one advanced.</p><p>In my free time, I usually do sports—you might find me pushing myself at the gym, hiking in the mountains, reading novels, or sitting in a bar with friends.</p>"
